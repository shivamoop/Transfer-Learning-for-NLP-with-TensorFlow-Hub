# Transfer-Learning-for-NLP-with-TensorFlow-Hub
This project guides you through transfer learning for natural language processing (NLP) using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub. You'll learn to leverage pre-trained text embedding models, fine-tune them on real-world datasets, and build text classification models.
